# The Score Board

Design and implement a Live Football World Cup Scoreboard library in Java that meets the given requirements.

## Start a New Match
When starting a new match, we assume an initial score of 0 â€“ 0. \
The system should capture the following parameters:
- Home Team
- Away Team

## Update Score
This operation receives two absolute scores and updates the match score accordingly:
- Home Team Score
- Away Team Score 

## Finish Match
This operation removes a match from the scoreboard.

## Get a Summary of Matches in Progress
The system returns a summary of all ongoing matches ordered by their total score. \
In case of a tie, matches should be ordered by their starting time (most recently started match appears first).

# Test Scenarios

## Starting a New Match
### Scenario 1.1: Adding a new match to the scoreboard.
Test: Create a match with "Team A" and "Team B". \
Expected Result: The scoreboard should show the match with the initial score "Team A 0 - Team B 0".

Test: Try to create a match with the same "Team A" and "Team B" again. \
Expected Result: An error or a message indicating that the match already exists.

### Scenario 1.3: Starting multiple unique matches.
Test: Add three different matches. \
Expected Result: All three matches should be displayed on the scoreboard with an initial score of 0 - 0.

## Updating the Score
### Scenario 2.1: Updating the score of an existing match.
Test: Update the score of "Team A" and "Team B" to 1 - 2. \
Expected Result: The scoreboard should reflect the updated score "Team A 1 - Team B 2".

### Scenario 2.2: Updating the score of a non-existent match.
Test: Try to update the score of a match that is not on the scoreboard. \

### Scenario 4.2: Retrieve the summary with matches sorted by total score.
Test: Add matches with different scores:
"Team A" vs "Team B" with score 2-1 (total 3).
"Team C" vs "Team D" with score 3-1 (total 4). \
Expected Result: The matches should be ordered with "Team C vs Team D" first, followed by "Team A vs Team B".

### Scenario 4.3: Retrieve the summary with matches having the same total score.
Test: Add matches with identical total scores but different starting times:
"Team A" vs "Team B" (started first) with score 2-2.
